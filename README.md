# UnityGitRepositoryManager

A "package" manager for Unity with a focus on ease of use and fast iteration.

Directly include repositories from other projects in your unity project.

I've found tools like the Unity package manager, Nuget for Unity or Projeny to be quite slow to use on a fast-changing codebase.
This is a tool for working on many repositories at once and pushing changes back.

This is a light wrapper around git with a UI for updating repositories.
