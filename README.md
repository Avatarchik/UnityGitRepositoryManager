# UnityGitRepositoryManager

A repository manager for Unity with a focus on ease of use and fast iteration.

I've found tools like the Unity package manager, Nuget for Unity or Projeny to be quite slow to use on a fast-changing codebase.
This is a tool for working on many repositories at once and pushing changes back.

This is a light wrapper around git with a UI for updating repositories.
